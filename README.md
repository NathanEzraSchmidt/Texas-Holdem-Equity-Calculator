# Texas-Holdem-Equity-Calculator
Very fast equity calculator for Texas Holdem

This is a console app, written in C. Instructions on how to use it are very simple and appear on the screen when the program launches. After the user has specified the hole cards for up to 16 players, it gives the exact winning and all tying frequencies, both in combinations and in percentages, for each player. It's very fast because it searches through all distinct combinations of board card ranks, and accounts for suits using combinatorics.
